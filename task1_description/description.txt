everything related to weddings for customers. They offer music, meals, and photography facilities which Customers can set 
everything with them in an online way. When customers want to reserve a wedding with them, they must use the meals and music 
band of the organization but using photography offer is completely optional. As the capacity of this organization is limited, 
they can only reserve a maximum of 65 and minimum 10 meals for the wedding and 50 photo shots.Also there is only one music band
that customers can use. before sumitting request they should login or sign up to the system and then they can go through the payment.
After submitting the request,they have only 48 hours to edit their request or 24 hours to cancel the order and ask for a refund.

chefs (as staff), managers and the banking system. Chefs can access the meals part to manage available meals, photographers access
to the photos section and singers to the music section. Also, they can access the submission part to see the requests of customers.
